# Derma Scan
A web application for detecting skin cancer from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with integrated mapping and dermatologist search functionality.

# 🔍 Overview
This project empowers users with a tool to detect potential skin cancer from uploaded skin images using deep learning. It also helps users find board-certified dermatologists nearby, using official data from the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD).

# 🌐 Live Demo
Coming Soon – Link to hosted app (if deployed)

# 🧠 Features
## CNN-Based Skin Cancer Detection
Upload an image of a skin lesion, and get predictions based on a trained CNN model.
